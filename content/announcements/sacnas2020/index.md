### Summary

Kyle Skelil presented a poster of his research at the Society for Advancement of Chicanos/Hispanics and Native Americans in Science (SACNAS) in October 2020. This poster, titled “Molecular Dynamics Simulations of Binding Energy Between Single Strand DNA and Silver Nanoparticles” demonstrated how we can use DNA and silver nanoparticle systems as novel methods of targeted drug carriers. The research simulates the ideal length of the DNA to find the most energetically favorable system, and is currently ongoing. Kyle won a first-prize presentation award for his poster!
