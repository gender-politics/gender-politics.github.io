Kyle joined us as a senior undergraduate in the NanoEngineering department, also minoring in business. Kyle worked on MD simulations of DNA-nanoparticles systems, motivated by their potential application to targeted drug delivery. He was also the president of the National Society of Black Engineers at UCSD during his time with us. He has since graduated, and began his studies in nanorobotics at UPenn in 2021.
