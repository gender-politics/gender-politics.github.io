Sergio uses quantum mechanical and force field methods to investigate solid/liquid interfaces relevant to electrochemistry. Currently, Sergio is probing the thermodynamics of copper electrodeposition on a gold surface. His simulations involve using specialized methods to simulate an applied voltage and utilizing computational XAS spectroscopy.
