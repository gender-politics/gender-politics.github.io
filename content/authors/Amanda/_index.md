My research goal was to enhance the efficiency of carbon dioxide recycling processes by modeling the thermodynamic properties of materials within systems. Utilizing molecular dynamics (MD) simulation and quantum chemical simulations, I determined and analyzed the thermodynamic properties. This research aimed to offer a potential solution to the global warming crisis. Now I am working at TSMC, focusing on developing and optimizing semiconductor manufacturing processes for improved efficiency and sustainability.
