abstract: "Li metal batteries applying Li-rich, Mn-rich (LMR) layered oxide cathodes present an opportunity to achieve high-energy density at reduced cell cost. However, the intense oxidizing and reducing potentials associated with LMR cathodes and Li anodes present considerable design challenges for prospective electrolytes. Herein, we demonstrate that, somewhat surprisingly, a properly designed localized-high-concentration electrolyte (LHCE) based on ether solvents is capable of providing reversible performance for Li||LMR cells. Specifically, the oxidative stability of the LHCE was found to heavily rely on the ratio between salt and solvating solvent, where local-saturation was necessary to stabilize performance. Through molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, this behavior was found to be a result of aggregated solvation structures of Li+/anion pairs. This LHCE system was found to produce significantly improved LMR cycling (95.8% capacity retention after 100 cycles) relative to a carbonate control as a result of improved cathode-electrolyte interphase (CEI) chemistry from X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and cryogenic transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM). Leveraging this stability, 4 mAh cm–2 LMR||2× Li full cells were demonstrated, retaining 87% capacity after 80 cycles in LHCE, whereas the control electrolyte produced rapid failure. This work uncovers the benefits, design requirements, and performance origins of LHCE electrolytes for high-voltage Li||LMR batteries."
