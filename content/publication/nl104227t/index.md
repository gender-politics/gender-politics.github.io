abstract: "We present the in situ nanoindentation experiments performed on suspended graphene devices to introduce homogeneous tensile strain, while simultaneously carrying out electrical measurements. We find that the electrical resistance shows only a marginal change even under severe strain, and the electronic transport measurement confirms that there is no band gap opening for graphene under moderate uniform strain, which is consistent with our results from the first-principles informed molecular dynamics simulation."
