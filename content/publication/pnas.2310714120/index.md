abstract: "The future application of Li metal batteries (LMBs) at scale demands electrolytes that endow improved performance under fast-charging and low-temperature operating conditions. Recent works indicate that desolvation kinetics of Li^+^ plays a crucial role in enabling such behavior. However, the modulation of this process has typically been achieved through inducing qualitative degrees of ion pairing into the system. In this work, we find that a more quantitative control of the ion pairing is crucial to minimizing the desolvation penalty at the electrified interface and thus the reversibility of the Li metal anode under kinetic strain. This effect is demonstrated in localized electrolytes based on strongly and weakly bound ether solvents that allow for the deconvolution of solvation chemistry and structure. Unexpectedly, we find that maximum degrees of ion pairing are suboptimal for ultralow temperature and high-rate operation and that reversibility is substantially improved via slight local dilution away from the saturation point. Further, we find that at the optimum degree of ion pairing for each system, weakly bound solvents still produce superior behavior. The impact of these structure and chemistry effects on charge transfer are then explicitly resolved via experimental and computational analyses. Lastly, we demonstrate that the locally optimized diethyl ether-based localized-high-concentration electrolytes supports kinetic strained operating conditions, including cycling down to −60 °C and 20-min fast charging in LMB full cells. This work demonstrates that explicit, quantitative optimization of the Li^+^ solvation state is necessary for developing LMB electrolytes capable of low-temperature and high-rate operation."
