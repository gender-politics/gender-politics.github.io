abstract: "The optimization of chemistries to enable the patterning of miniaturized DNA barcodes using microfluidics flow channels is described (see picture). Experiment and theory reveal that solvent mixtures in which counterions are strongly associated with the negatively charged DNA oligomers may be harnessed to produce high quality, high density DNA microarray patterns over a large area."
