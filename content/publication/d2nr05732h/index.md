abstract: "Understanding the role of ferroelectric polarization in modulating the electronic and structural properties of crystals is critical for advancing these materials for overcoming various technological and scientific challenges. However, due to difficulties in performing experimental methods with the required resolution, or in interpreting the results of methods therein, the nanoscale morphology and response of these surfaces to external electric fields has not been properly elaborated. In this work we investigate the effect of ferroelectric polarization and local distortions in a BaTiO3 perovskite, using two widely used computational approaches which treat the many-body nature of X-ray excitations using different philosophies, namely the many-body, delta-self-consistent-field determinant (mb-ΔSCF) and the Bethe–Salpeter equation (BSE) approaches. We show that in agreement with our experiments, both approaches consistently predict higher excitations of the main peak in the O–K edge for the surface with upward polarization. However, the mb-ΔSCF approach mostly fails to capture the L2,3 separations at the Ti–L edge, due to the absence of spin–orbit coupling in Kohn–Sham density functional theory (KS-DFT) at the generalized gradient approximation level. On the other hand, and most promising, we show that application of the GW/BSE approach successfully reproduces the experimental XAS, both the relative peak intensities as well as the L2,3 separations at the Ti–L edges upon ferroelectric switching. Thus simulated XAS is shown to be a powerful method for capturing the nanoscale structure of complex materials, and we underscore the need for many-body perturbation approaches, with explicit consideration of core-hole and multiplet effects, for capturing the essential physics in these systems."
