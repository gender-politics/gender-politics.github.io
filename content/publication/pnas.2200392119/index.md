abstract: "All-climate temperature operation capability and increased energy density have been recognized as two crucial targets, but they are rarely achieved together in rechargeable lithium (Li) batteries. Herein, we demonstrate an electrolyte system by using monodentate dibutyl ether with both low melting and high boiling points as the sole solvent. Its weak solvation endows an aggregate solvation structure and low solubility toward polysulfide species in a relatively low electrolyte concentration (2 mol L^−1^). These features were found to be vital in avoiding dendrite growth and enabling Li metal Coulombic efficiencies of 99.0%, 98.2%, and 98.7% at 23 °C, −40 °C, and 50 °C, respectively. Pouch cells employing thin Li metal (50 μm) and high-loading sulfurized polyacrylonitrile (3.3 mAh cm^−2^) cathodes (negative-to-positive capacity ratio = 2) output 87.5% and 115.9% of their room temperature capacity at −40 °C and 50 °C, respectively. This work provides solvent-based design criteria for a wide temperature range Li-sulfur pouch cells."
